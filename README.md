# üçΩÔ∏è FoodMood - AI Food Recommender

## Project Overview

FoodMood is an intelligent food recommendation system that uses advanced AI and machine learning to suggest personalized dishes based on your mood, preferences, and constraints. The system analyzes your natural language input to understand your cravings and matches them with the perfect food options from a curated dataset of Indian and international cuisines.

The project combines semantic similarity matching with AI-powered constraint analysis to provide highly personalized recommendations that consider factors like preparation time, budget, health consciousness, comfort seeking, and social context.
